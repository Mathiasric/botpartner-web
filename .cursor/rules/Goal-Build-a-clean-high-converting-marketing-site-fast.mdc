Workflow:
- Propose 2–3 layout options max, then implement one. No long explanations.
- Always ship in small, testable increments (one section/component at a time).

Design system:
- Use a simple system: max 2 fonts, max 2 button styles, consistent spacing scale.
- Keep copy short. One primary CTA per page/section.

Responsive:
- Design mobile-first, then add one tablet breakpoint (~768px) and desktop.
- Avoid hover-dependent UI. Touch-friendly sizes.

Quality:
- Prefer simple HTML/CSS/vanilla JS. No new frameworks or dependencies.
- Do not refactor unrelated code. Minimal diffs.

Brand constraint:
- Keep existing "botpartner.no" class conventions intact (do not remove/rename).
